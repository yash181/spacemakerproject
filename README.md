How to run the program:

1) Download finalproj.zip and extract the files.
2) Please download the appropriate Nodejs installer from https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and install in the computer.
3) Navigate to this directory (inside of the extracted folder) in the terminal and run:
		
			npm install

Once installed run the following command:

			npm start 


4) The current existing input file is 'data.json' which I've made using the example input. To use your own input, please name the file as data.json and replace it in the data folder.
 

5) Go to http://localhost:3000/ on your browser.

Hoep you enjoy using the project! 

I've used many libraries including openlayers, turf.js, geojson-validation and GeoJson. 

I've also extensively used stackoverflow and google. One resource which has particularly been helpful was the Openlayers workshop which can be found at https://openlayers.org/workshop/

NOTE: If you use my sample input file and run the program, you will probably not see the polygons at first because there are only three very small polygons located in London. You can zoom in on London in the world map and then the polygons will be visible.
